                                    <p>The Authors create smart templates that users use to create documents.  The best people to draft these templates are the knowledge workers in the organization, who are intimately involved in, and knowledgeable about, the business decisions and considerations involved in the drafting of the document. They may be professionals such as attorneys, or mid-to-senior level executives.</p>

                                    <h3 class="block-title">Template Architecture</h3>
                                    <p>There are 4 major templates, ordered in a hierarchy, from largest to smallest:</p>
                                        <ol class="list">
                                            <li>Project Templates</li>
                                            <li>Document Templates</li>
                                            <li>Provision Templates</li>
                                            <li>Term Templates</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    <p>Each template, other than the Term Template, is made up of its smaller components.  For instance, a Project Template consists of Document Templates, a Document Template consists of Provision Templates, and so on. You may have also noticed Document Template Type, but we will explain that later.  Let's start with a discussion of the most basic template, which is the Term Template. </p>

                                <p>Term Templates, on a fundamental level, are variables that represent a value (or multiple values) that will be determined by the User.  As you can see from above below screen shot, you can create New Term Template, or alternatively, you can import them from CSV.</p>
                                <div class="screenshot-holder">
                                    <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/author/term-template.png" alt="screenshot" />
                                </div> 
                                <h6>When creating a new Term Template, there are 6 Term Template types to choose from:</h6>  
                                <ol> 
                                    <li>Text</li>

                                </ol>
                                <div class="screenshot-holder">
                                    <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/author/term-template-new.png" alt="screenshot" />
                                </div>

                                    <h3 class="block-title">1. Text</h3>
                                    <p>Text is the field that hold text variable.  Under Term Type, choose Text. Then under Variable field, you name the variable.  Characters that are permitted are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore.  Special characters are NOT permitted, except for the underscore.  An example would be "company_name" (without quotes).</p>
                                    <p>The Display Name field is what the User will see when prompted to input the field.  This can contain special characters including spaces, which should help in describing briefly the information the is requested from the User - for example, "Company Name". It can also be phrased as a question, as as: "What is the Company Name?"</p>
                                    <p>The Placeholder is the "Default" text.  It is required.  If you are not sure what to put into this field, you can also in brackets "[  ]".</p>
                                    <p>Help field is the text that the User will see on the right hand side of the screen when as Help text.  [You can also imbed videos, pictures or links.]</p>
                                </div><!--//section-block-->
                                <div id="2textplus" class="section-block">
                                    <h3 class="block-title">2. Text Plus</h3>
                                    <p>Text Plus  is similar to the Text variable except that in addition, it  permits Users to create sub-fields, that is a separate text box that appears right after the current text box.  This is handy if the contract contemplates one or more parties.  There are two additional check-boxes: 1. Automatically insert commas/and will insert the commas and 'and' at appropriate places.  2.  Insert line break will insert a new line before the new text box; this is helpful for lists.  </p>
                                    <p> Under Variable field, you name the variable.  Characters that are permitted are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore.  Special characters are NOT permitted, except for the underscore.  An example would be "company_name" (without quotes).</p>
                                    <p>The Display Name field is what the User will see when prompted to input the field.  This can contain special characters including spaces, which should help in describing briefly the information the is requested from the User - for example, "Company Name". It can also be phrased as a question, as as: "What is the Company Name?"</p>
                                    <p>The Placeholder is the "Default" text.  It is required.  If you are not sure what to put into this field, you can also in brackets "[  ]".  Each sub-field will start out with this Placeholder text.</p>
                                    <p>Help field is the text that the User will see on the right hand side of the screen when as Help text.  [You can also imbed videos, pictures or links.]</p>

                                    <h3 class="block-title">3. Text Area</h3>
                                    <p>Text Area is similar to the Text variable except that it creates a larger text area in the middle panel.  This is handy if the contract contemplates an insertion of a large body of custom text.  However, one limitation of Text Area is that it will not permit redlining of the inside text.  The text area box will disappear if held within false boolean expressions, and appear if held within true boolean expressions.    </p>
                                    <p> Under Variable field, you name the variable.  Characters that are permitted are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore.  Special characters are NOT permitted, except for the underscore.  An example would be "company_name" (without quotes).</p>
                                    <p>The Display Name field is what the User will see when prompted to input the field.  This can contain special characters including spaces, which should help in describing briefly the information the is requested from the User - for example, "Company Name". It can also be phrased as a question, as as: "What is the Company Name?"</p>
                                    <p>You can set the initial number of rows of the Text Area, and also whether that area will expand when filled, or remain fixed with appearance of a scoll bar.  There is no Placeholder for Text Area.  </p>
                                    <p>Help field is the text that the User will see on the right hand side of the screen when as Help text.  [You can also imbed videos, pictures or links.]</p>

                                    <h3 class="block-title">3. Number</h3>
                                    <p>Number field allows the User to input numbers.  While it is true that you can put numbers into text boxes as well, Number field permits <b>math</b> function to work.  In short, it allows for simple arithmetic, such as additions and subtractions.  For example, in the Provision Template, you can do: <code>{{math number_variable_name 'add' 10}}</code> </p>
                                    <p>Under Variable field, you name the variable.  Characters that are permitted are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore.  Special characters are NOT permitted, except for the underscore.  An example would be "employee_number" (without quotes).</p>
                                    <p>The Display Name field is what the User will see when prompted to input the field.  This can contain special characters including spaces, which should help in describing briefly the information the is requested from the User - for example, "Employee Number". It can also be phrased as a question, as as: "What is the Employee Number?"</p>
                                    <p>The Placeholder is the "Default" text.  It is required.  If you are not sure what to put into this field, you can set it to zero.</p>

                                    <p>Help field is the text that the User will see on the right hand side of the screen when as Help text.  [You can also imbed videos, pictures or links.]</p>

                                    <h3 class="block-title">4. Date</h3>
                                    <p>Date field allows the User to input dates.  The Date Picker calendar will also appear for the User to make it easier to pick a date.  While it is true that you can put dates into text boxes as well, Date field permits <b>math</b> function to work.  In short, it allows for simple arithmetic, such as additions and subtractions.  For example, in the Provision Template, you can do:<code> {{math date_variable_name 'add-year' 7}}</code>  </p>
                                    <p>Under Variable field, you name the variable.  Characters that are permitted are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore.  Special characters are NOT permitted, except for the underscore.  An example would be "start_date" (without quotes).</p>
                                    <p>The Display Name field is what the User will see when prompted to input the field.  This can contain special characters including spaces, which should help in describing briefly the information the is requested from the User - for example, "Start Date". It can also be phrased as a question, as as: "When did employee start?"</p>
                                    <p>The Placeholder is the "Default" date.  It is required.  If you are not sure what to put into this field, you can set it to today.</p>

                                    <p>Help field is the text that the User will see on the right hand side of the screen when as Help text.  [You can also imbed videos, pictures or links.]</p>

                                </div><!--//section-block-->

                                    <h3 class="block-title">5. Boolean</h3>
                                    <p>Boolean holds values TRUE or FALSE, and displays to the User as a Radio button.  They must choose one or the other, and null value is not permitted.  Because of its flexibility, you can also use it as a choice of two, such as Include/Exclude or Registered/Non-Registered. Although appearing simple, Booleans are probably the most frequently used variable types, as they are able to manipulate the document beyond the purview of the input field. For example, when used in conjunction with IF statement in the Provision Template, you can add or delete large portions of text using the following syntax:</p>
<p><pre><code>{{#if boolean_name}}This text will appear if boolean is true.{{else}} Otherwise, this text will appear.{{/if}}</code></pre></p> 
                                    <p>Under Variable field, you name the variable.  Characters that are permitted are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore.  Special characters are NOT permitted, except for the underscore.  An example would be "is_registered_transaction" (without quotes).</p>
                                    <p>The Display Name field is what the User will see when prompted to input the field.  This can contain special characters including spaces, which should help in describing briefly the information the is requested from the User - for example, "Type of Transaction". It can also be phrased as a question, as as: "Is this Registered Transaction?"</p>
                                    <p>Inclusion text and Exclusion text are the text that will appear in the radio button as options.  The default values are Include and Exclude, but if you are using Boolean as a choice-of-two, then you can rename them as necessary, such as "Registered Trasaction"/"Non-Registered Transaction".</p>
                                    <p>The Placeholder is the "Default" value.  It is required.  It is initially set to TRUE.</p>

                                    <p>Help field is the text that the User will see on the right hand side of the screen when as Help text.  [You can also imbed videos, pictures or links.]</p>

                                    <p>While Boolean is flexible and useful, especially in conjunction with the use of IF, it is limited to a choice of two: TRUE and FALSE values.  When more alternatives than two are required, Variant is the Term Template that can handle the task because it can have unlimited options.  
                                    <p>Under Variable field, you name the variable.  Characters that are permitted are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore.  Special characters are NOT permitted, except for the underscore.  An example would be "filing_type" (without quotes).</p>
                                    <p>The Display Name field is what the User will see when prompted to input the field.  This can contain special characters including spaces, which should help in describing briefly the information the is requested from the User - for example, "Filing Type". It can also be phrased as a question, as as: "What Document are you filing?"</p>
                                    <p>Click on Add option, and give name to the Option. This option name will be used in the Provision Template, if you want to use it with the IF statement.</p>
                                    <p>Out of the Options, you need to choose a Default value.  It is required.  The dropdown will update to reflect the Options that have been added.  If you are not sure what to put into this field, you can set it as the first item in the dropdown.</p>
                                    <p>Display as gives you a choice to show the choices as radio buttons or a dropdown menu.</p>

                                <p>Provision Templates use Term Templates, regular text and other functions to build paragraphs, or "Provisions".  These Provisions will be collected later to form a Document via the Document Template later on.</p>

                                    <p>Display name is the name that will be used when identifying this provision in the Document Template section.  It is only used to for this purpose.</p>
                                    <p>Style is a pre-configured style which will tell the app how to present this Provision to the User.  Normal is default. [There is also the Term Sheet style.]</p>
                                    <p>Condition is a boolean that needs to be true to display this Provision.  You can leave it blank and have this always be shown.  </p>
                                    <p>Template is where you type in regular text, together with embedded Term Templates and other Provision Functions to create logic-enabled template.  This is the screen in which Authors will spend the most time.</p>

                                    <p>If, Else and Unless statements work together with booleans to make the magic happen!  This is because long text strings can be wrapped in IF clauses, so that it appears and/or disappears when boolean values match. The syntax is:</p>
<p><pre><code>{{#if boolean_termtemplate}} This is the text that will appear if boolean_termtemplate is TRUE. {{else}} This is the text that will appear if boolean_termtemplate is FALSE. {{/if}}</code></pre></p>

                                    <p>Be mindful of the # when opening the if clause, and always end it with {{/if}}.</p>
                                    <p>Unless is the opposite of If; you can think of it as if-not.  The syntax is: 
<p><pre><code>{{#unless boolean_termtemplate}} This is the text that will appear if boolean_termtemplate is FALSE. {{else}}  This is the text that will appear if boolean_termtemplate is TRUE. {{/unless}}</code></pre></p>

                                    <p>Again, be mindful of # when opening unless, and always close with {{/unless}}</p>
                                    <p><code>{{else}}</code> always has to be within <code>{{#if bool-name}} ... {{/if}}</code> or <code>{{#unless bool-name}} ... {{/unless}}</code>  tags. Both If and Unless can be nested within other If and Unless statements.  </p>

If there are "enter/return" characters in between, it is unable to process it.  One way to work around this limitation is to use If statements for each paragraph.]</p>

                                    <p>ifCond is used when complex logic is required.  The syntax is similar to if, but it is able to handle two inputs. For examples:
<p><pre><code>
{{#ifCond bool1 'and' bool2}} If both bool1 and bool2 are true, this text will appear.{{else}} Otherwise, this will appear. {{/ifCond}} </code> </pre></p>
<p><pre><code>{{#ifCond bool1 'or' bool2}} If both bool1 or bool2 are true, this text will appear.{{else}} Otherwise, this will appear. {{/ifCond}}</code></pre></p>
                                    <p>The 8 operators are as follows: <code>'and'</code>, <code>'and-not'</code>, <code>'not-and'</code>, <code>'not-and-not'</code>, <code>'or'</code>, <code>'not-or'</code>, <code>'or-not'</code>, and <code>'not-or-not'</code>.  The order of first and second booleans are important, especially when determining operators such as 'and-not', since the second boolean must be false for the condition to pass.  The nested content is displayed when the result of the expression is true.

                                    <p>For date manipulation, only additions are currently supported.  They are: <code>'add-day'</code>, <code>'add-month'</code>, and <code>'add-year'</code>.
